Sonic Gather Battle 2 is supposed to be the new sgb after the DRM.

# Details
SonicSAGE (Sonic Gather Battle) is a sonic fangame based on Sonic Gather Battle by sega. The game had a good to bad history after the 1.3 Update in December of 2015.
The game was reported to have a type of DRM where typing "Sonic Gather Battle Cheats" would close the browser and the game would become unplayable.
This game is supposed to be what SGB was trying to be, just not as evil.
